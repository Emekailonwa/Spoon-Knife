  As it’s your birthday today, I wanted to take
the opportunity to tell you something that
has been on my mind for a while now…
I may have just the tiniest crush on you! <br>

It’s no big deal and I’ve totally got it under
control, though! I’m keeping it super cool!<br>

I hope you have a great birthday, you
beautiful person!
